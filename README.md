# Penfold_VCF
[KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) project for the circuit and PCB of R.A. Penfolds VCF design which I adapted as a Eurorack powered module.
The original circuit is taken from [the book, "Electronic Synthesiser Construction" by R. A. Penfold](https://sdiy.info/wiki/Penfold_synthesiser), published by Babani in 1986.

I have kept to the original design as much as possible, but added power and switched INT.CV via [a Eurorack spec bus](https://doepfer.de/home_e.htm).

The circuit and PCB are verfied to work and being used as part of my modular build.
